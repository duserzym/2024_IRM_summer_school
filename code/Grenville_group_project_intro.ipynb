    "## Geologic and paleogeographic background on the Grenville orogen and the assembly of supercontinent Rodinia\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rodinia is a Proterozoic supercontinent that formed around 1 Ga and broke up through the Neoproterozoic\n",
    "- Grenville orogen is the last major event that led to the assembly of Rodinia\n",
    "- It is a collisional orogenesis that involved the North America craton, Laurentia, and at least the South America craton, Amazonia\n",
    "- What led to this collision was a period of very rapid plate tectonic motion of Laurentia together with previously assembled continents from high latitudes to the equator\n",
    "- As a result, the scale of the collision was huge--bigger than the Hymalayans; and the regional metamorphism associated with the collision reached granulite facies--a temperature of up to 950 C!\n",
    "- This implies that had the rocks in the orogen acquired previous remanence, they were overwritten during heating and cooling of the orogen\n",
    "- Therefore, magnetic remanence of rocks of the Grenville orogen will be helpful for constaining the position of Laurentia and Rodinia post-orogen, where there is a 300 Myr lack of data\n",
    "- However, using metamorphic rocks for paleomagnetism is difficult because slow cooling has an effect of lowering natural blocking temperature. This makes dating the age of the paleomagnetic remanence difficult. Metamorphic fluid and heat-related chemical processes also adds uncertainty to the origin of the remanence (TRM or CRM), making the poles even harder to date. "
